The dynamics you face when trying to approach the woman at the bar is very, very similar to the process you face when trying to speak to a client. Which brings me to the reason behind this post. 

This post isn't for marketeers. This post is for any and all potential business owners, CEO-level folk and the like who've been contacted by a marketing person and felt annoyed by the message. 

I want to pull back the curtain and give you some insight into how that message comes about and how it actually takes a lot of energy to get that message to you. That for someone to send that message requires a financial and emotional investment. null

In fact, that stuff ranks WAY higher on the list of "stuff we pay attention to" and the other list of "this is how we make a decision". Marketing is all about trying to get a product/service ranked as highly as possible on those two lists. 

As much as you want your customers to buy your product/service, a marketer wants you to provide feedback (notice I said feedback and not buy) to their message. 

Because... Just like the guy at the bar who's trying to pick up the girl. Ultimately he really wants to know if she's interested. That's the key question for him because if she is, then he knows that he can do things like get a phone number, setup a date. null

I assure you, every marketer (just like every guy) will be grateful.
